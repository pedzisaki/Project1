    "3.\tWhat are the factors that are associated with high levels of interest (correlation)?\n",
    "4.\tFor each course in the latest survey, what are the relative number of enrollments in the various degree programs? The degree field needs to be cleaned and condensed into a smaller number of categories. For example, all the engineering majors should be collapsed into a single engineering category.\n"
